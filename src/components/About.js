                        <p className="content-paragraph">Hi! My name is Lauri, I'm 26 years old and living in Tampere.
                            I worked as a chef 4 years and I started my IT-career in 2018 after Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Technology.
                            After school I worked in ICT-local support for about 2 years. Currently I'm working as an ICT-Specialist, mostly remotely.
                        </p>

                        <p className="content-paragraph">Never worked as a programmer but coding has been my hobby over 4 years now.
                            My interests are in Front End development and working hard every day to be a real programmer someday.
                        </p>

                        <p className="content-paragraph">I have a home office dog named Luca and he likes his job.
                            My favourite color is orange, as you can see.
                            I enjoy good food, playing video games, coding and learning new things.
                        </p>
